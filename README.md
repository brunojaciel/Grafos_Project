# Grafos_Project
Representation, paths and connectivity in graphs

# Features of software

Allows you to create a graph, with the number of vertices and edges/arcs entered by the user. It also lets you include or exclude vertices and edges/arcs.

From the informed graph, it is possible to verify if the graph is connected or not. And if it is not connected, it identifies the strongly connected sub-graphs of the graph. It is also possible to check the sequence of vertices covered by searches in Width and Depth.
